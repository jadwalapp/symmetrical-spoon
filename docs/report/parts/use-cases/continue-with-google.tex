The ``Continue with Google Sequence Diagram'', shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/continue-with-google}}, illustrates how users can authenticate with Jadwal using their Google account. The user first obtains an access token from GoogleAuth through our application and shares it with the backend. The backend validates the token and retrieves user details through GoogleAuth. If the token is valid, the backend ensures the user exists in the database, creating a record if necessary, and associates the userâ€™s Google account with it. It then verifies the ``sid'', issuing a JSON Web Token (JWT) for successful authentication or returning an error, such as Permission Denied, for invalid credentials. This process ensures secure and efficient authentication.
