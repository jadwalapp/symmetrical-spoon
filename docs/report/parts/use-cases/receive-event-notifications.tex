The ``Receive Event Notifications Sequence Diagram'', shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/receive-event-notifications}}, depicts the flow of how local event reminders are scheduled and delivered to the user. When the user sets a reminder for a calendar event, it is saved using EventKit. The application periodically retrieves all upcoming events with reminders from EventKit and schedules local notifications for each of them via the iOS notification system. At the scheduled time, iOS automatically triggers the corresponding local notification, ensuring the user is reminded promptly. This flow assumes the user has granted the necessary notification permissions and is logged into the application.
