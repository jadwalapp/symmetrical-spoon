The ``Connect Calendar Sequence Diagram'', shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/connect-calendar}}, illustrates the streamlined process of connecting an iOS device to Jadwal's Baikal calendar server. The sequence begins when the user taps ``Easy Setup'' in the app.

The process follows a secure flow where the app first requests a Magic Token of type CalDAV from the backend. Using this token, the app then requests a user-specific \textit{.mobileconfig} profile that contains the pre-configured CalDAV credentials. When the user downloads this profile, iOS Settings takes over to handle the secure installation process.

The diagram illustrates the following possible paths:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Success Path:} The user approves the profile installation in iOS Settings, which then automatically configures the CalDAV account. Upon returning to the app, the user is shown a success page after the system confirms the calendar configuration is complete.
  \item \textbf{User Denial Path:} If the user denies the profile installation, they return to the app which displays "Setup cancelled - Try again later", allowing them to retry the process at their convenience.
  \item \textbf{Configuration Failure Path:} If the profile installation is approved but the calendar configuration fails, the app shows a "Calendar setup failed" message, prompting the user to either contact support or retry the process.
\end{enumerate}

This implementation leverages iOS's native configuration profile system to ensure a secure and user-friendly setup process. The use of Magic Tokens and encrypted \textit{.mobileconfig} profiles during transit guarantees that calendar credentials are transmitted and stored securely on the user's device. The clear error handling paths ensure users receive appropriate guidance when issues occur during any stage of the setup process.
