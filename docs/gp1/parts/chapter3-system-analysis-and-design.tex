\chapter{System Analysis and Design}

The development of a complex calendar management system like Jadwal requires careful analysis of requirements and thoughtful system design to ensure robust functionality and seamless user experience. This chapter presents a detailed examination of Jadwal's architecture, from its core requirements to the intricate relationships between system components. Through use case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams, and database design (both ER and Relational), we provide a comprehensive blueprint of how Jadwal transforms its innovative concepts into a practical, functioning system.

\section{Introduction}

A well-designed system requires a good understanding of both functional and non-functional requirements to meet user expectations and deliver a seamless experience.

This section shows the functional and non-functional requirements which is the backbone of Jadwal's development. The functional requirements focus on core features, such as user authentication, calendar integration and event management. Ensuring the users can effectively manage their schedules. The non-functional requirements focuses on performance, security, compatibility, and user experience, ensuring the application stands well with the industry standards by providing efficient interface.

Combining all these requirements helps in the design and implementation of Jadwal which will lead to a better application solving real issues and meeting the needs of the user.

\section{Functional Requirements}

The following requirements outline the core features and capabilities that Jadwal must provide to fulfill its purpose as an intelligent calendar management system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user shall be able to access their account using either Google OAuth or magic link via Email. For new users, a new account is created, and for existing users, they are given access to their account directly.
    \item The system shall send a welcome email to new users.
    \item The user should be able to create a calendar.
    \item The user should be able to connect a calendar using CalDAV.
    \item The user should be able to connect their WhatsApp account.
    \item The user should be able to add events manually.
    \item The user should be able to view integrated calendar.
    \item The user should be able to manage scheduling conflicts.
    \item The user should be able to schedule prayer times.
    \item The system shall send event notifications to the user.
    \item The system shall add the WhatsApp extracted events to the calendar. If a conflict occurs, the user shall get a notification to resolve the conflict with suggestions.
\end{itemize}

Each functional requirement listed above will be explained in details through a use case description in the coming sections.

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

While functional requirements define what the system does, non-functional requirements specify how the system performs its functions. These requirements focus on the quality attributes, performance standards, and technical constraints that ensure Jadwal delivers a reliable, secure, and user-friendly experience.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Compatibility:} The app shall be compatible with iOS devices running iOS 16.0 or later.
    \item \textbf{Performance:} The app shall load the main calendar view within 3 seconds on 5G with speeds above 200mpbs.
    \item \textbf{User Experience:} The user interface shall follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for consistency and ease of use.
    \item \textbf{Security:} All data transmissions between the app and servers shall be encrypted using HTTPS.
\end{itemize}


\section{Security Architecture}

In today's digital world, security is a key concern for any application that handles user data. Jadwal places a strong emphasis on ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the platform for its users, implementing multiple layers of security measures to protect user data.

\subsection{Authentication: Magic Link and JWT Tokens}

To provide secure authentication, Jadwal implements Magic Link authentication. Instead of relying on traditional username and password combinations, which is vulnerable to various attacks, such as credentials leakage through database dumps. To mitigate this, Jadwal sends the users trying to authenticate a secure magic link to their verified email address. A magic link is a special URL that contains a secure token. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    https://jadwal.app/magic-link?token=some-uuid
\end{verbatim}

In this URL, \texttt{some-uuid} is the secure token, and the complete URL is what we call the magic link. When sent to the user's email, clicking this link proves they have access to the email account they're trying to use.

When a user logs in using the Magic Link sent to their email, Jadwal secures the user's account by verifying the magic token provided. This ensures that the account can only be accessed by the legitimate user who has access to the registered email account. To enhance security, the magic token has a limited lifetime of 15 minutes, significantly reducing the window of opportunity for potential attacks.

Upon successful magic link verification, Jadwal issues a JWT (JSON Web Token) signed with the platform's private key. This digital signature serves as a cryptographic guarantee of the token's authenticity, allowing the system to verify that tokens haven't been tampered with and were legitimately issued by Jadwal.

\subsection{Token Storage and Security}

To ensure the security of authentication tokens, Jadwal implements secure storage practices for storing the magic token in the database. Magic tokens are never stored in their original form; instead, they are protected using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm before being saved in the database. When verifying user tokens, the system hashes the user-provided token and compares it with the stored hash, ensuring that even in the unlikely event of a database breach, the original tokens remain secure.

\subsection{Secure Logout Implementation}

Jadwal implements a secure logout mechanism by removing the authentication token from the user's device upon logout. This practice ensures that once a user logs out, their session token cannot be reused for unauthorized access, maintaining the integrity of user sessions.

\subsection{Transparency Through Open Source}

As part of our commitment to security and privacy, Jadwal will be released as open-source software. This transparency allows security experts and users to verify our security implementations and privacy practices. Users can inspect exactly how their data is handled and verify that our privacy commitments are upheld through code review.


\section{System Architecture}

Jadwal implements a modern, distributed architecture leveraging gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) for efficient communication between its components. The system is divided into several key services, each responsible for specific functionality while maintaining high performance and reliability.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/architecture.png}
    \caption{Jadwal System Architecture}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The architecture, shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}}, consists of the following main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Frontend (Mishkat)}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item iOS SwiftUI application implementing the client-side gRPC communication
              \item Handles user interface and local state management
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Backend (Falak)}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Core gRPC server implementing the primary business logic
              \item Auth Service managing user authentication and session management
              \item Calendar Service handling calendar operations and integration
              \item CalDAV Client enabling connection to external calendar services
              \item Event Consumer processing WhatsApp events from the message queue
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{WhatsApp Service}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Node.js gRPC server managing WhatsApp communication
              \item WhatsApp Web.js client for message monitoring
              \item Event Producer publishing detected events to the message queue
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Message Queue}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item RabbitMQ handling asynchronous event processing
              \item Ensures reliable delivery of WhatsApp events to the backend
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Database}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item PostgreSQL storing user data, calendar information, and events
              \item Maintains data consistency across all services
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This architecture enables several key benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance}: gRPC's use of Protocol Buffers and HTTP/2 ensures efficient communication between services
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Separate services can be scaled independently based on load
    \item \textbf{Reliability}: Message queue ensures no events are lost during processing
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}: Clear separation of concerns makes the system easier to maintain and update
\end{itemize}
