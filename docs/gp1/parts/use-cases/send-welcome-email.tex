The "sending a welcome email Sequence Diagram", shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/send-welcome-email}}, shows the process of sending a welcome email to new customers. It begins with the system retrieving user data from the database using the FetchUserInfo function. Once the user data is fetched, the system requests a magic link email template via Get Magic Link Template. The template is then customized with the retrieved user data using Fill Magic Link Template by UserData. The system sends the filled email template to the email server via SendEmail, which delivers the email. Finally, the email server responds with EmailSentResponse, confirming the email's successful dispatch. This sequence ensures personalized and reliable email delivery.
