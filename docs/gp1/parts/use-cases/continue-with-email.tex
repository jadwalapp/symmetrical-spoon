The "Continue with Email Sequence Diagram", shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/continue-with-email}}, illustrates the process of email-based magic link authentication, involving interactions between the User, Backend, Database, and EmailServer. The process begins when the user initiates email authentication process. The backend executes the CreateCustomerIfNotExists function to retrieve an existing customer record or create a new one if none exists. Once the customer is identified, the backend generates a magic token and its hashed version using the GenerateMagicToken function. The hashed token is stored in the database, and a magic link containing the token is created. The backend then sends the magic link to the user's email using the SendEmail function via the email server. The user clicks the magic link, triggering the CompleteFlow(MagicToken) request to the backend, where the provided token is validated against the stored hashed token in the database. If the tokens match, authentication succeeds, and the backend issues a JSON Web Token (JWT) to the user for future access. In cases where the token is invalid, expired, or the customer record is missing, the system responds with appropriate errors, such as PermissionDenied or EntryNotFound. This diagram demonstrates a secure flow for handling authentication via email magic links.
