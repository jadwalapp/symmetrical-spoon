The ``View Integrated Calendar Sequence Diagram'', shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/view-integrated-calendar}}, demonstrates how the app leverages iOS EventKit to provide a unified calendar view. The sequence begins when the user opens the calendar view in the app.

The app uses EventKit to access calendar and event data directly from iOS's calendar database. This includes events from our Baikal server (synced via CalDAV) and any other calendars the user has configured. EventKit provides real-time updates through its observer system, ensuring the app's display stays synchronized with the system calendar.

This client-side approach eliminates the need for separate backend queries, as EventKit efficiently manages data access and synchronization. The app focuses on presenting the data in a user-friendly way, applying custom styling and organization while maintaining consistency with the iOS Calendar app.
