The ``Extract Events from WhatsApp Sequence Diagram'', shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/extract-events-whatsapp}}, illustrates the event extraction workflow through a message queue architecture. The system consists of several components working together, with a focus on security through encryption at rest:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The WhatsApp Service (using whatsapp-web.js) monitors non-group messages
  \item RabbitMQ message queues handle asynchronous processing:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Message Queue for WhatsApp messages
          \item Calendar Queue for confirmed events
        \end{itemize}
  \item Message Consumer processes messages and coordinates with the LLM
  \item Calendar Consumer handles CalDAV integration
  \item Push notification service for user updates
  \item Database stores sensitive data encrypted at rest:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item WhatsApp messages are encrypted with a dedicated key
          \item CalDAV credentials are encrypted with a separate key
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The workflow operates as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The WhatsApp Service filters out group messages and publishes individual messages to a RabbitMQ queue
  \item The Message Consumer:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Retrieves the message context from the database
          \item Sends the context to the LLM Service for analysis
          \item Handles different event statuses returned by the LLM:
                \begin{itemize}
                  \item \textit{NO\_EVENT}: No action needed
                  \item \textit{HAS\_EVENT\_BUT\_NOT\_CONFIRMED}: Continues monitoring
                  \item \textit{HAS\_EVENT\_DENIED}: Clears chat history
                  \item \textit{HAS\_EVENT\_AGREED}: Publishes to calendar queue
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
  \item When an event is agreed upon, the Calendar Consumer:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Retrieves encrypted CalDAV credentials from database
          \item Initializes the WhatsApp Events calendar on CalDAV server if needed
          \item Adds the event directly to the calendar via CalDAV
          \item Sends a push notification to user's devices
          \item Clears the chat history from database
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This queue-based architecture ensures reliable message processing and proper separation of concerns between message analysis and calendar integration. The system's ability to handle different event statuses allows for natural conversation flow while maintaining accurate event tracking. All sensitive data, including WhatsApp messages and CalDAV credentials, are encrypted at rest in the database, while the actual calendar events are stored securely on the CalDAV server.
