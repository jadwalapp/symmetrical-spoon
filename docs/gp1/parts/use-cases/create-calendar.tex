The ``Create Calendar Sequence Diagram'', shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/create-calendar}}, illustrates how calendar creation is handled through iOS's native calendar system. When a user wants to create a new calendar, the app uses EventKit to interact with iOS's calendar system.

The process is straightforward:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The app receives the user's calendar creation request with details like name and color
    \item EventKit is used to create the calendar in iOS's native calendar system
    \item The calendar becomes available to all apps with calendar access on the device
\end{enumerate}

This approach ensures that calendars are properly integrated with iOS's calendar infrastructure and can be accessed by other calendar apps on the device.
