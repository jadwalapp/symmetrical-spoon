The "Connect WhatsApp Sequence Diagram", shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:seq/connect-whatsapp}}, illustrates the two-phase authentication process for connecting a user's WhatsApp account to Jadwal. The sequence begins with the InitiateWhatsApp gRPC call, where the user provides their phone number to the Backend.

The Backend then communicates with the WhatsApp service to request a linking code. This interaction follows two possible paths:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If the linking code request succeeds:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The user receives the linking code in their WhatsApp application
          \item The user initiates the CompleteWhatsApp gRPC call with the linking code
          \item The Backend validates the code with WhatsApp
          \item Upon successful validation, the WhatsApp authentication credentials are securely stored in the Database for future use
        \end{enumerate}
  \item If the linking code request fails:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The Backend immediately returns an InitiateWhatsApp failure response to the user
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

During the completion phase, if the linking code validation fails, the Backend returns a CompleteWhatsApp failure response, requiring the user to restart the process. This secure two-phase authentication ensures that only legitimate WhatsApp account owners can connect their accounts to Jadwal while maintaining the integrity of the WhatsApp integration.
