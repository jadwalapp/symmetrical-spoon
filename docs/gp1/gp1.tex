\chapter{Introduction}


\section{Background of the Project}

 Calendars have been around a long time now, and they are a handy tool for humans. Both who are busy and who want to plan their days. People throughout history have used paper for calendars, but now with technology, things have changed. Calendars are digital now, and they can even be shared with others!

As the world is becoming one big village with globalization, people tend to squeeze every last minute of their days since competition is higher. Calendars help in that since they allow people to plan their days easily and keep track of when to meet people and do other activies.

People these days use multiple calendars and sometimes forget to insert an event to the correct calendar.
\section{Problem Statement}

Keeping your calendar up to date with event information is challenging, especially with the rise of many informal communcation channels like WhatsApp. People nowadays discuss when and where they will meet using those informal communication tools. This leads to calendars being out of sync from real life events you are committed to and might harm relations. The problem lies in the cumberness of adding events to a calendar manually, and sometimes people are busy, you just forget that you didn't add the event to your calendar. Our Jadwal app aims to solve this issue for users in an elegant way that makes it seamless to manage your time confidently.

\section{Objectives of the Project}

The main objectives of Jadwal are:
\begin{itemize}
    
    \item To integrate all the calendars into Jadwal's single calendar view to make viewing and managing all the events easy.
    \item To develop an intelligent calendar management system that automatically extracts events from the informal communication channels like WhatsApp and adds them to the user's main calendar.
    \item To significantly reduce the time users spend on manual calendar management.
    \item To create a user friendly interface that allows users to easily add events to the calendar.
    \item  To prioritize and automatically schedule daily routines such as waking time, sleeping time and prayer time.
    \item To implement a smart resolution system that notifies users of scheduling conflicts and provides easy options for resolution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope of the Project}

Jadwal is not just another calendar application; it's a comprehensive time management tool designed to aggregate and optimize your existing calendars and data sources. The scope of the project includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of an iOS application as the primary platform.
    \item Integration with calendars using CalDAV.
    \item WhatsApp message parsing for event extraction (subject to technical feasibility).
    \item Target audience: Busy professionals, students, and anyone juggling multiple schedules.
    \item User testing phase to ensure ease of use and effectiveness. Our testing methods will include:
    \begin{itemize}
            \item Beta testing with a diverse group of users.
            \item Analytics to track user behavior and app performance.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\section{Significance of the Project}

Jadwal's significance can be summarized in the following points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Time is Money}: Since time is the only asset you can't get more of, Jadwal tries to make it less painful and less time consuming to have a good calendar throughout your day by parsing events from your informal communication channels like WhatsApp automatically.
    \item \textbf{Prayer First Calendar}: Prayer times come first, then your daily scheduled items.
    \item \textbf{Reduced Human Error}: Automated event extraction and addition to calendars minimize the risk of missing important events or appointments due to manual input errors or forgetfulness.
    \item \textbf{Conflict Resolution}: The smart resolution system helps users identify and resolve scheduling conflicts efficiently, reducing stress and improving overall time management.
    \item \textbf{Holistic View of Commitments}: By integrating multiple calendars into a single view, Jadwal provides users with a comprehensive overview of their commitments across various aspects of life, facilitating better decision-making and work-life balance.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations of the Project}

Nothing is perfect, and our project is not an outlier. The limitations we have figured out about it are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item WhatsApp integration allows the app to read the users messages, so it would be difficult to prove that privacy risk associated with our integration isn't compromised.
    \item WhatsApp integration might not always be there, they are a third-party.
    \item Learning new technologies for iOS development might require more time than anticipated.
    \item Accuracy of our algorithms to detect keywords indicating an event agreement has happened, especially for languages other than English.
    \item Time and manpower constraints may limit the number of features we can implement.
    \item Dependency on third-party APIs and their limitations.
    \item We may face a challenges to test the app due to lack of users for testing our app
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization of the Senior Project}

Our project plan can be illustrated in the following gantt chart, \textbf{Figure \ref{fig:project-gantt-chart}}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gantt.png}
    \caption{Project Gantt Chart}
    \label{fig:project-gantt-chart}  
    \item In Figure \ref{fig:project-gantt-chart} shows the project plan and how the project has been distributed throughout the term. 
    \section{Conclusion}
    \item In conclusion, the shift from traditional calendars to digital ones has changed how people organize their schedule. While digital calendars offer easy and conflict free scheduling which makes managing easy. Discussion on informal communication channels like WhatsApp has impacted the planning events and commitments. This impact often leads to missed appointments and scheduling conflicts, especially for someone who is busy.
    Jadwal aims to solve this issue by providing a seamless and automated solution for integrating informal communication with the application so that no one misses an event and have conflicts.

\chapter{Literature Review}
\section{Introduction}
\item In the modern world, managing time effectively is important for balancing personal and professional responsibilities. The increasing complexity of schedules usually results in missing an important event and overlapping commitments. To solve these challenges, we introduce Jadwal, an innovative iOS-based schedule management application, aims to help individuals and professionals to organize their daily lives.
Jadwal focuses on solving the issue by drawing inspiration from existing solutions like Clockwise, Motion, Reclaim AI, and Calendi, Jadwal outstands by introducing advance features such as conflict resolution, task prioritization, event extraction from informal communicating channels and prioritizing prayer times, which is a unique feature which is not found in any competing applications. 
\\
In developing Jadwal, we have drawn inspiration from and built upon existing research and products in the field of intelligent calendar management. Some key references include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clockwise (https://www.getclockwise.com/):} A smart calendar assistant that optimizes schedules and manages team coordination \cite{clockwise}. Clockwise's approach to intelligent time blocking and meeting optimization provides valuable insights for Jadwal's automated scheduling features.
    \item \textbf{Motion (https://www.usemotion.com/):} Motion's Intelligent Calendar takes your meetings, your tasks, your to-do list, your activities, and creates one perfect, optimized schedule to get it all done \cite{motion}.
    \item \textbf{Reclaim AI (https://reclaim.ai/):} An intelligent time management tool that helps optimize schedules and automate tasks \cite{reclaim}.
    \item \textbf{Calendi (https://calendi.ai/):} Calendi describes itself as: ``Calendi is an AI calendar system. Use it for scheduling tasks, automating meetings, and witness the future of calendar.'' \cite{calendi}
    \item \textbf{An Exploratory Study of Calendar Use:} ``Prospective remembering is the use of memory for remembering to do things in the future, as different from retrospective memory functions such as recalling past events.'' \cite{tungare2008exploratorystudycalendaruse}
    \item \textbf{WhatsApp Integration:} Our research indicates that direct WhatsApp integration for event extraction has not been widely implemented in existing calendar applications, making this a unique feature of Jadwal.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

\newpage

In Figure \ref{fig:features-table} The table compares \textit{Jadwal}, our project, with four other scheduling applications—Clockwise, Motion, Reclaim AI, and Calendi—based based on several key features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open Source}: \textit{Jadwal} stands out as the only application that is open-source, allowing users and developers to access, modify, and improve the code. The other applications do not provide this.
    \item \textbf{WhatsApp Integration}: \textit{Jadwal} stands out again as the only application that connects and extract the event discussed over the platform by the user.
    \item \textbf{CalDAV Support}: \textit{Jadwal}, Clockwise, and Reclaim AI offer CalDAV support, which allows users to integrate calendars from different sources, while Motion and Calendi either does not sipport this.
    \item \textbf{Conflict Resolution}: All listed applications, including \textit{Jadwal}, supports conflict resolution, allowing users to manage overlapping events efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Prioritize Prayer Times}: \textit{Jadwal} is the only one offering this feature where the user be able to have prayer time scheduled
    \item \textbf{iOS Application}: \textit{Jadwal} is available on iOS, along with Clockwise, Reclaim AI, and Motion. The availability of Calendi on iOS is uncertain.
    \section{Conclusion}
    \item Jadwal represents itself by offering a seamless calendar application which is user friendly and outstands by providing solution to all the problems which is not yet addressed by other tools like Clockwise, Motion, Reclaim AI, and Calendi. WhatsApp integration is Jadwal’s unique features for event extraction. These features distinguish Jadwal from existing applications, Jadwal addresses to the issues that is not yet solved.
    The comparison highlights Jadwal's abilities that integrate multiple calendars, resolve scheduling conflicts.

\end{figure}

\newpage

In Figure \ref{fig:database-design}, the tables and the relations between them in Jadwal's system is shown. The \texttt{customer} is the main table. Three tables have foreign keys that reference it. The \texttt{auth\_google} and \texttt{magic\_link} tables are used for auth, and they both save the info required to the authentication and hint at which authentication methods are allowed for a specific customer.

A third table related to the \texttt{customer} table is the \texttt{calendar\_accounts} table. It makes it possible to link multiple calendars to one customer under a calendar account. Then the heirarchy continues, each \texttt{calendar\_accounts} entry contains many \texttt{vcalendar} entries. And each \texttt{vcalendar} entry contains many \texttt{vevent} entries. And each \texttt{vevent} entry has exceptions and alarms related to it\\via \texttt{vevent\_exception} and \texttt{valarm} respectively.
\section{Conclusion}
\item Jadwal stands as a comprehensive and innovative solution for scheduling with great design. The use cases and database architecture are well described that helps in creating the application systematically. The use cases clearly define how users interact with the system, covering all the features like Continue with email, Resolve conflicts, WhatsApp integration, scheduling prayer time and many more. The database design is the backbone of Jadwal, which clearly shows how the system works and how the data is managed perfectly. In conclusion, Jadwal is well described which makes it easy to understand how everything is working and would be easy to track everything that is happening in the backend.
