        With rapid globalization, time management has became a real challenge. This paper introduces Jadwal, which proposes an automatic schedule management system where an individual can integrate multiple calendars and extract the events that have been discussed in informal communication channels, such as Whatsapp.

        \textbf{Key Objectives:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To develop an intelligent calendar management system that automatically extracts events from the informal communication channels like WhatsApp and adds them to the user's main calendar.
            \item To create a user friendly interface that allows users to easily add events to the calendar.
            \item To implement a smart resolution system that notifies users of scheduling conflicts and provides easy options for resolution.
            \item To integrate all the calendars into Jadwal's single calendar view to make viewing and managing all the events easy.
            \item To prioritize and automatically schedule daily routines such as prayer time.
            \item To significantly reduce the time users spend on manual calendar management.
        \end{itemize}

In a fast-paced and interconnected world, everyone struggles to manage their time efficiently, especially for someone who has multiple tasks every day. Jadwal addresses all these challenges by introducing features that help bridge gaps left by existing calendar applications. Jadwal ensures a user-friendly interface for users to manage their schedules and avoid missing important events.

Jadwal integrates with CalDAV, a standardized protocol that facilitates seamless synchronization across various calendar platforms. This enables users to effortlessly connect and manage their calendars from different devices and applications, such as Apple Calendar and Google Calendar, bringing everything together into a unified ecosystem.

A standout feature is Jadwal's use of a state-of-the-art LLM for WhatsApp event extraction. By analyzing informal conversations where events are often agreed upon, Jadwal ensures that no appointment or commitment is missed â€” even those that happen casually through chat.

The scheduling of prayer times highlights Jadwal's sensitivity to user culture and daily priorities. By making prayer times first-class citizens in the calendar, Jadwal empowers users to plan their day around their values.

Conflict management is another feature that enhances user control, offering clear options for resolving overlapping events, thereby minimizing the risk of missed or mishandled appointments. By integrating and managing all calendars under one roof, Jadwal simplifies time management in a way few other applications achieve.

Throughout the project, we adopted a systematic approach. Detailed use cases mapped user interactions clearly, covering core flows like account setup, WhatsApp integration, calendar connection, prayer scheduling, and conflict resolution. The database design and system architecture provided a solid technical backbone, ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability.

However, the journey was not without challenges. Initially, we planned to build a custom calendar storage system, but deeper research revealed the complexities of the CalDAV standard. Pivoting to integrating Baikal was a critical learning moment that taught us the importance of adaptability, pragmatic engineering choices, and working with open standards.

Technically, we gained hands-on experience across a wide range of areas: mobile-first design with SwiftUI, backend systems with Golang and ConnectRPC, scalable messaging with RabbitMQ, CI/CD workflows with Docker and Traefik, and security best practices throughout.

Looking ahead, Jadwal can evolve even further. Potential improvements include real-time calendar updates when WhatsApp messages change, deep-linking users directly into new event details, and onboarding flows that fully automate setup. With more resources, Jadwal could expand to Android and web platforms, becoming a complete cross-device scheduling assistant.

In conclusion, Jadwal stands as a unique and innovative calendar solution that bridges real-world scheduling gaps. It combines technical rigor with user-centric design to empower individuals to manage their time more effectively. We are proud of what we achieved and hope Jadwal becomes an inspiration for creating digital tools that respect users' daily realities, cultural values, and personal goals.
