\chapter{Introduction}

Time management has become increasingly complex in our interconnected world, where individuals juggle multiple calendars, commitments, and communication channels. This chapter introduces Jadwal, an intelligent iOS-based calendar management system designed to address these modern challenges. We will explore the background, objectives, scope, and significance of this project, highlighting how it aims to revolutionize personal time management through intelligent automation and integration with communication platforms.


\section{Background of the Project}

Calendars have been around a long time now, and they are a handy tool for humans. Both who are busy and who want to plan their days. People throughout history have used paper for calendars, but now with technology, things have changed. Calendars are digital now, and they can even be shared with others!

As the world is becoming one big village with globalization, people tend to squeeze every last minute of their days since competition is higher. Calendars help in that since they allow people to plan their days easily and keep track of when to meet people and do other activities.

People these days use multiple calendars and sometimes forget to insert an event to the correct calendar.

\section{Problem Statement}

Keeping your calendar up to date with event information is challenging, especially with the rise of many informal communication channels like WhatsApp. People nowadays discuss when and where they will meet using those informal communication tools. This leads to calendars being out of sync from real life events you are committed to and might harm relations. The problem lies in the cumbersomeness of adding events to a calendar manually. And when people are busy, they just forget that they didn't add the event to their calendar. Our Jadwal app aims to solve this issue for users in an intelligent way that makes it seamless to manage your time confidently.

\section{Objectives of the Project}

The development of Jadwal is driven by clear, measurable objectives that address the current challenges in calendar management. These objectives focus on creating an intelligent system that seamlessly integrates multiple calendars, automates event extraction, and prioritizes user efficiency while maintaining prayer schedules. Each objective has been carefully defined to ensure the final product delivers meaningful value to users.

The main objectives of Jadwal are:
\begin{itemize}

    \item To integrate all the calendars into Jadwal's single calendar view to make viewing and managing all the events easy.
    \item To develop an intelligent calendar management system that automatically extracts events from the informal communication channels like WhatsApp and adds them to the user's main calendar.
    \item To significantly reduce the time users spend on manual calendar management.
    \item To create a user friendly interface that allows users to easily add events to the calendar.
    \item To prioritize and automatically schedule daily routines such as prayer time.
    \item To implement a smart resolution system that notifies users of scheduling conflicts and provides easy options for resolution.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scope of the Project}

Jadwal is not just another calendar application; it's a comprehensive time management tool designed to aggregate and optimize your existing calendars and data sources. The scope of the project includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Development of an iOS application as the primary platform.
    \item Integration with calendars using CalDAV.
    \item WhatsApp message parsing for event extraction using state-of-the-art LLMs (subject to technical feasibility).
    \item Target audience: Busy professionals, students, and anyone juggling multiple schedules.
    \item User testing phase to ensure ease of use and effectiveness. Our testing methods will include:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Beta testing with a diverse group of users.
              \item Analytics to track user behavior and app performance.
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Significance of the Project}

In today's fast-paced environment, effective time management is not just a convenience—it's a necessity. Jadwal addresses critical gaps in existing calendar solutions by introducing innovative features that align with modern users' needs. The project's significance extends beyond simple calendar management, offering transformative benefits for personal productivity, religious observance, and professional organization. By tackling the challenges of fragmented schedules and missed commitments, Jadwal represents a significant advancement in how people manage their time in the digital age.

Jadwal's significance can be summarized in the following points:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Time is Money}: Since time is the only asset you can't get more of, Jadwal tries to make it less painful and less time consuming to have a good calendar throughout your day by parsing events from your informal communication channels like WhatsApp automatically.
    \item \textbf{Prayer First Calendar}: Prayer times come first, then your daily scheduled items.
    \item \textbf{Reduced Human Error}: Automated event extraction and addition to calendars minimize the risk of missing important events or appointments due to manual input errors or forgetfulness.
    \item \textbf{Conflict Resolution}: The smart resolution system helps users identify and resolve scheduling conflicts efficiently, reducing stress and improving overall time management.
    \item \textbf{Holistic View of Commitments}: By integrating multiple calendars into a single view, Jadwal provides users with a comprehensive overview of their commitments across various aspects of life, facilitating better decision-making and work-life balance.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations of the Project}

While Jadwal introduces innovative solutions to calendar management, it is essential to acknowledge and understand its current constraints and limitations. These limitations stem from various factors including technological boundaries, privacy concerns, third-party dependencies, and resource constraints. By identifying these limitations early in the development process, we can better manage user expectations and plan future improvements to address these challenges.

Nothing is perfect, and our project is not an outlier. The limitations we have figured out about it are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item WhatsApp integration allows the app to read the user's messages, so it would be difficult to prove that privacy hasn't been breached.
    \item WhatsApp integration might not always be there, they are a third-party.
    \item Learning new technologies for iOS development might require more time than anticipated.
    \item Accuracy of our algorithms to detect keywords indicating an event agreement has happened, especially for languages other than English.
    \item Time and manpower constraints may limit the number of features we can implement.
    \item Dependency on third-party APIs and their limitations.
    \item We may face a challenges to test the app due to lack of users for testing our app
\end{itemize}

\section{Organization of the Senior Project}

To ensure systematic development and timely delivery of Jadwal, we have established a detailed project timeline with clear milestones and deliverables. The Gantt chart, shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:project-gantt-chart}}, illustrates our project's phases, tasks, and their respective durations.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/gantt.png}
    \caption{Project Gantt Chart}
    \label{fig:project-gantt-chart}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, the shift from traditional calendars to digital ones has changed how people organize their schedule.
While digital calendars offer easy and conflict free scheduling which makes managing easy.
Discussion on informal communication channels like WhatsApp has impacted the planning events and commitments.
This impact often leads to missed appointments and scheduling conflicts, especially for someone who is busy.

Jadwal aims to solve this issue by providing a seamless and automated solution for integrating informal communication with the application so that no one misses an event or have conflicts.

\chapter{Literature Review}

The landscape of calendar management and scheduling applications has evolved significantly with technological advancement and changing user needs. This chapter presents a comprehensive analysis of existing solutions, market research, and technological foundations that inform Jadwal's development. Through examining current tools, academic research, and user behavior patterns, we identify gaps in existing solutions and validate Jadwal's innovative approach to calendar management.

\section{Introduction}

In the modern world, managing time effectively is important for balancing personal and professional responsibilities.
The increasing complexity of schedules usually results in missing an important event and overlapping commitments.
To solve these challenges, we introduce Jadwal, an innovative iOS-based schedule management application, aims to help individuals and professionals to organize their daily lives.

Jadwal focuses on solving the issue by drawing inspiration from existing solutions like Clockwise, Motion, Reclaim AI, and Calendi, Jadwal stands out by introducing advance features such as conflict resolution, task prioritization, event extraction from informal communicating channels and prioritizing prayer times, which is a unique feature which is not found in any competing applications.

In developing Jadwal, we have drawn inspiration from and built upon existing research and products in the field of intelligent calendar management.
Some key references include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clockwise (https://www.getclockwise.com/):} A smart calendar assistant that optimizes schedules and manages team coordination \cite{clockwise}. Clockwise's approach to intelligent time blocking and meeting optimization provides valuable insights for Jadwal's automated scheduling features.
    \item \textbf{Motion (https://www.usemotion.com/):} Motion's Intelligent Calendar takes your meetings, your tasks, your to-do list, your activities, and creates one perfect, optimized schedule to get it all done \cite{motion}.
    \item \textbf{Reclaim AI (https://reclaim.ai/):} An intelligent time management tool that helps optimize schedules and automate tasks \cite{reclaim}.
    \item \textbf{Calendi (https://calendi.ai/):} Calendi describes itself as: ``Calendi is an AI calendar system. Use it for scheduling tasks, automating meetings, and witness the future of calendar.'' \cite{calendi}
    \item \textbf{An Exploratory Study of Calendar Use:} ``Prospective remembering is the use of memory for remembering to do things in the future, as different from retrospective memory functions such as recalling past events.'' \cite{tungare2008exploratorystudycalendaruse}
    \item \textbf{WhatsApp Integration:} Our research indicates that direct WhatsApp integration for event extraction has not been widely implemented in existing calendar applications, making this a unique feature of Jadwal.
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/competitors/motion-time-blocking.png}
    \caption{Motion's Time Blocking Feature}
    \label{fig:motion-time-blocking}
\end{figure}

Jadwal platform, such as linking the calendar to WhatsApp for automatic event addition and integrating prayer times, which adds a unique level of customization and day organization.

\subsection{Reclaim AI}

Reclaim.ai offers the following features: It is an AI-powered platform designed to manage tasks, habits, meetings, and personal events seamlessly.
Figure~\ref{fig:reclaim-landing} shows the the landing page of Reclaim and their focus on AI as you can see.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/competitors/reclaim-landing.png}
    \caption{Reclaim Landing}
    \label{fig:reclaim-landing}
\end{figure}

Reclaim.ai provides features such as smart time blocking, which automatically schedules tasks based on their priority and deadlines, integrates with tools like Google Calendar, Slack, and project management platforms (e.g., Asana, Jira, and Todoist), and supports habit tracking with auto-rescheduling to adapt to life changes. Figure~\ref{fig:reclaim-integrations} shows the integrations that this platform supports.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/competitors/reclaim-integrations.png}
    \caption{Reclaim Integrations}
    \label{fig:reclaim-integrations}
\end{figure}

While these features enhance productivity and optimize time management, Reclaim.ai does not include features like WhatsApp integration for automatically adding events or prayer time scheduling, both of which are unique to the Jadwal platform. These features provide users with cultural and practical benefits that further enhance their daily organization.

\subsection{Calendi}

Calendi.ai claims to offer features focused on speeding up scheduling with AI-powered assistance.

It claims to allow users to add tasks via text or voice input and automates meetings scheduling, including sending links and calendar invites.
Those claims are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:calendi-feature-voice-input}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/competitors/calendi-feature-voice-input.png}
    \caption{Calendi Features of Voice Input and Automatic Meeting}
    \label{fig:calendi-feature-voice-input}
\end{figure}

Calendi claims to integrate with platforms like Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook, making it compatible across multiple systems.
This is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:calendi-replace-em}, as they say ``We replace them all, help you save `clock emoji' `money emoji' and schedule better.''

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/competitors/calendi-replace-em.png}
    \caption{Calendi Claims to Replace Them All}
    \label{fig:calendi-replace-em}
\end{figure}

It claims to provide intelligent assistance by analyzing habits and tasks, suggesting improvements, and incorporating external factors like weather or transit schedules. Those are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:calendi-features}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/competitors/calendi-replace-em.png}
    \caption{Calendi Claims to Replace Them All}
    \label{fig:calendi-features}
\end{figure}

However, it does not offer unique features like WhatsApp integration or prayer time scheduling, which are distinct to Jadwal.

Also the website as of writing this part, on 26 Nov 2024, is broken and not working. This can be illustrated via the broken timer shown in Figure~\ref{fig:calendi-broken-timer} and many other things that are broken.

\section{Survey Results}

We have conducted a survey using Google Forms, and have sent it out to our peers in the university, and also shared it on our social media, especially LinkedIn, to get more diverse responses. That is since our main audiences are students, employees, and who do both at the same time. The results were fascinating. Especially since 75 responses were recorded with their email to authenticate the responses.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:survey-status}, the results showed that 8\% only were both employed and students, while 53\% were students only and 39\% were employed only. We believe this is a good mix between the two audience we are aiming to get responses from.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/survey/status.png}
    \caption{Survey Respondents Status}
    \label{fig:survey-status}
\end{figure}

Based on Figure~\ref{fig:age-range}, it is important to note that 72\% of our respondents were of the age range 20-30 years.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/survey/age.png}
    \caption{Age Range}
    \label{fig:age-range}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:use-calendar}, 66.7\% of people reported that they a calendar application to manage their daily schedule. This shows that people might be interested in a better way of managing their schedules that could elevate their time management skills.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/survey/use-calendar.png}
    \caption{Percentage of People Who Use Calendars to Ones Who Don't}
    \label{fig:use-calendar}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:platform-to-discuss}, the results showed us the need for our app to exist, since 70.7\% of the population use WhatsApp to discuss upcoming events! Another big percentage, 53.3\% used Email also. Our app won't be focusing on this, nevertheless, this is also an opportunity in the future to help those people who use Emails and might not find the flow easy to schedule the events in the calendar.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/survey/platform-to-discuss.png}
    \caption{Platform Used to Discuss}
    \label{fig:platform-to-discuss}
\end{figure}

Although 21.3\% might not seem like a lot, but as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:usefullness}, 58.7\% of the population reported they would find it extremely useful to have a WhatsApp integration that automatically adds events from your conversations to the calendar?

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/survey/usefullness.png}
    \caption{Usefulness of Having a WhatsApp Integration}
    \label{fig:usefullness}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:forget-to-add}, on average, 21.3\% forget to add events to their calendar. That is great news, since our differentiating factor is the direct WhatsApp integration that should be able to solve this.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \caption{Chart of Forgetting to Add Likeliness}
    \label{fig:forget-to-add}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:number-of-calendars}, 41.3\% use 2 calendars, that shows the need for a integrated view of calendars.

\begin{figure}[!h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/survey/number-of-calendars.png}
    \caption{Number of Calendars}
    \label{fig:number-of-calendars}
\end{figure}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:events-per-week}, 53.3\% of people have 1-3 calendar events per week. That might seem a little, but 33.3\% have 4-6 calendar events per week.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\section{Conclusion}

Through this literature review, we have identified several key gaps in existing calendar management solutions. While platforms like Clockwise, Motion, Reclaim AI, and Calendi have made significant strides in intelligent scheduling and calendar integration, none provide a comprehensive solution that addresses the full spectrum of modern scheduling challenges. The review reveals three primary opportunities for innovation:

First, while existing solutions focus on traditional calendar management, there remains an untapped potential in integrating informal communication channels. Jadwal's WhatsApp integration addresses this gap, offering automated event extraction from everyday conversations—a feature notably absent in current market offerings.

Second, our analysis shows that while many applications offer conflict resolution features, none combine this with prayer time prioritization, creating a unique opportunity to serve users who prioritize religious obligations alongside professional commitments.

Finally, the review demonstrates that current solutions often operate in isolation, whereas Jadwal's approach of unifying multiple calendars while maintaining intelligent event extraction and conflict resolution presents a more holistic solution to modern scheduling challenges.

These findings validate Jadwal's approach and highlight its potential to address significant unmet needs in the calendar management space, particularly in combining automation, religious considerations, and comprehensive calendar integration.

\chapter{System Analysis and Design}

The development of a complex calendar management system like Jadwal requires careful analysis of requirements and thoughtful system design to ensure robust functionality and seamless user experience. This chapter presents a detailed examination of Jadwal's architecture, from its core requirements to the intricate relationships between system components. Through use case diagrams, activity diagrams, class diagrams, and database design (both ER and Relational), we provide a comprehensive blueprint of how Jadwal transforms its innovative concepts into a practical, functioning system.

\section{Introduction}

A well-designed system requires a good understanding of both functional and non-functional requirements to meet user expectations and deliver a seamless experience.

This section shows the functional and non-functional requirements which is the backbone of Jadwal's development. The functional requirements focus on core features, such as user authentication, calendar integration and event management. Ensuring the users can effectively manage their schedules. The non-functional requirements focuses on performance, security, compatibility, and user experience, ensuring the application stands well with the industry standards by providing efficient interface.

Combining all these requirements helps in the design and implementation of Jadwal which will lead to a better application solving real issues and meeting the needs of the user.

\section{Functional Requirements}

The following requirements outline the core features and capabilities that Jadwal must provide to fulfill its purpose as an intelligent calendar management system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The user shall be able to access their account using either Google OAuth or magic link via Email. For new users, a new account is created, and for existing users, they are given access to their account directly.
    \item The system shall send a welcome email to new users.
    \item The user should be able to create a calendar.
    \item The user should be able to connect a calendar using CalDAV.
    \item The user should be able to connect their WhatsApp account.
    \item The user should be able to add events manually.
    \item The user should be able to view integrated calendar.
    \item The user should be able to manage scheduling conflicts.
    \item The user should be able to schedule prayer times.
    \item The system shall send event notifications to the user.
    \item The system shall add the WhatsApp extracted events to the calendar. If a conflict occurs, the user shall get a notification to resolve the conflict with suggestions.
\end{itemize}

Each functional requirement listed above will be explained in details through a use case description in the coming sections.

\newpage

\section{Non-Functional Requirements}

While functional requirements define what the system does, non-functional requirements specify how the system performs its functions. These requirements focus on the quality attributes, performance standards, and technical constraints that ensure Jadwal delivers a reliable, secure, and user-friendly experience.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Platform Compatibility:} The app shall be compatible with iOS devices running iOS 16.0 or later.
    \item \textbf{Performance:} The app shall load the main calendar view within 3 seconds on 5G with speeds above 200mpbs.
    \item \textbf{User Experience:} The user interface shall follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines for consistency and ease of use.
    \item \textbf{Security:} All data transmissions between the app and servers shall be encrypted using HTTPS.
\end{itemize}


\section{Security Architecture}

In today's digital world, security is a key concern for any application that handles user data. Jadwal places a strong emphasis on ensuring the security and trustworthiness of the platform for its users, implementing multiple layers of security measures to protect user data.

\subsection{Authentication: Magic Link and JWT Tokens}

To provide secure authentication, Jadwal implements Magic Link authentication. Instead of relying on traditional username and password combinations, which is vulnerable to various attacks, such as credentials leakage thorugh database dumps. To mitigate this, Jadwal sends the users trying to authenticate a secure magic link to their verified email address. A magic link is a special URL that contains a secure token. For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    https://jadwal.app/magic-link?token=some-uuid
\end{verbatim}

In this URL, \texttt{some-uuid} is the secure token, and the complete URL is what we call the magic link. When sent to the user's email, clicking this link proves they have access to the email account they're trying to use.

When a user logs in using the Magic Link sent to their email, Jadwal secures the user's account by verifying the magic token provided. This ensures that the account can only be accessed by the legitimate user who has access to the registered email account. To enhance security, the magic token has a limited lifetime of 15 minutes, significantly reducing the window of opportunity for potential attacks.

Upon successful magic link verification, Jadwal issues a JWT (JSON Web Token) signed with the platform's private key. This digital signature serves as a cryptographic guarantee of the token's authenticity, allowing the system to verify that tokens haven't been tampered with and were legitimately issued by Jadwal.

\subsection{Token Storage and Security}

To ensure the security of authentication tokens, Jadwal implements secure storage practices for storing the magic token in the database. Magic tokens are never stored in their original form; instead, they are protected using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm before being saved in the database. When verifying user tokens, the system hashes the user-provided token and compares it with the stored hash, ensuring that even in the unlikely event of a database breach, the original tokens remain secure.

\subsection{Secure Logout Implementation}

Jadwal implements a secure logout mechanism by removing the authentication token from the user's device upon logout. This practice ensures that once a user logs out, their session token cannot be reused for unauthorized access, maintaining the integrity of user sessions.

\subsection{Transparency Through Open Source}

As part of our commitment to security and privacy, Jadwal will be released as open-source software. This transparency allows security experts and users to verify our security implementations and privacy practices. Users can inspect exactly how their data is handled and verify that our privacy commitments are upheld through code review.


\section{System Architecture}

Jadwal implements a modern, distributed architecture leveraging gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) for efficient communication between its components. The system is divided into several key services, each responsible for specific functionality while maintaining high performance and reliability.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/architecture.png}
    \caption{Jadwal System Architecture}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The architecture, shown in \textbf{Figure~\ref{fig:architecture}}, consists of the following main components:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Frontend (Mishkat)}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item iOS SwiftUI application implementing the client-side gRPC communication

              \item Event Producer publishing detected events to the message queue
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Message Queue}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item RabbitMQ handling asynchronous event processing
              \item Ensures reliable delivery of WhatsApp events to the backend
          \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Database}
          \begin{itemize}
              \item PostgreSQL storing user data, calendar information, and events
              \item Maintains data consistency across all services
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This architecture enables several key benefits:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Performance}: gRPC's use of Protocol Buffers and HTTP/2 ensures efficient communication between services
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Separate services can be scaled independently based on load
