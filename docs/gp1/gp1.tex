        With rapid globalization, time management has became a real challenge. This paper introduces Jadwal, which proposes an automatic schedule management system where an individual can integrate multiple calendars and extract the events that have been discussed in informal communication channels, such as Whatsapp.

        \textbf{Key Objectives:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item To develop an intelligent calendar management system that automatically extracts events from the informal communication channels like WhatsApp and adds them to the user's main calendar.
            \item To create a user friendly interface that allows users to easily add events to the calendar.
            \item To implement a smart resolution system that notifies users of scheduling conflicts and provides easy options for resolution.
            \item To integrate all the calendars into Jadwal's single calendar view to make viewing and managing all the events easy.
            \item To prioritize and automatically schedule daily routines such as prayer time.
            \item To significantly reduce the time users spend on manual calendar management.
        \end{itemize}

In a fast-paced and interconnected world, everyone struggles to manage their time efficiently, especially for someone who has multiple tasks every day. Jadwal addresses all these challenges by introducing features that help to bridge all the gaps that other platforms are unable to offer. Jadwal ensures a user-friendly interface for the user to manage their schedule and avoid missing any events.

Jadwal integrates with CalDAV, a standardized protocol that facilitates seamless synchronization across various calendar platforms. This allows users to effortlessly connect and manage their calendars from different devices and applications, such as Apple Calendar and Google Calendar, making everything in one ecosystem.

Jadwal's state-of-the-art LLM WhatsApp event extraction feature enhances the application by extracting events from WhatsApp, which is an informal communication channel that people most likely use for discussing events. This creates a gap that could lead to missing or conflicting events, and Jadwal aims to solve this problem.

The feature of scheduling prayer times highlights Jadwal as unique, and Jadwal sees it as important since it is a daily activity. Clearing and holding a place for this event would help the user to manage their day more efficiently.

The feature that makes Jadwal stand out is managing events effectively by offering features like suggesting conflict resolution and integrating other calendars. This would reduce the chances of the user missing any events.

Integration with CalDAV allows Jadwal to connect all the calendars that the user has and bring them to one platform, which helps a lot in managing the day. Why do we separate calendars to organize one day for one person?

Throughout the project, a systematic approach was taken in developing Jadwal. The use cases clearly define how users interact with the system, covering all the features like Continue with Email, Resolve Conflicts, WhatsApp Integration, Scheduling Prayer Time, and many more. The database architecture and system design showcase the backbone of Jadwal, illustrating how the system works and how the data is managed perfectly. These technical aspects ensure that Jadwal is well-structured and easy to understand, making it simple to track everything happening in the backend.

In conclusion, Jadwal stands out from all the existing solutions and provides an innovative calendar application that bridges the gaps and helps the user to manage their day more efficiently. With its comprehensive features, user-friendly interface, and robust technical foundation, Jadwal is poised to revolutionize the way individuals manage their time in today's fast-paced world.
